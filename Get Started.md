This web app is build using React on top of Gatsby.

To run this app on local machine run command `npm start`, which will start the server on **development** mode.

Currently this webapp is deployed on Github pages.

This web app uses version control system **Git**, and it has 2 remote repository. `origin` and `trackCode`. `origin` is only for **github pages** and don't need to touch that. If ready to deploy run `npm run deploy`, and **react-gh-pages** will do the rest and it will upload the build version(master) in the server.

`trackCode` repository is to keep my code on Github. Push code to `trackCode` for safekeeping.
