This web app is build using **React** on top of **Gatsby**.

To run this app on local machine run command `gatsby develop`, which will start the server on **development** mode. More command line scripts can be found on `package.json` file.

Currently this webapp is deployed on Github pages.

This web app uses version control system **Git**, and it has 2 remote repository. `origin` and `trackCode`. `origin` is only for **github pages** and no need to touch that. If ready to deploy on Github Page, run `npm run deploy`, and **react-gh-pages** will do the rest and it will upload the build version(master) in the server.

`trackCode` repository is to keep my code on Github. Push code to `trackCode` for safekeeping.
